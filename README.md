## Mr Repair - Service Request Management App
Mr Repair is a full-stack React + Firebase application designed to streamline and simplify home service request management.

It connects customers needing services (like electrical, plumbing, or appliance repair) with service workers, and enables easy tracking of service requests‚Äîfrom booking to completion.

## üåü About

**Mr Repair** streamlines home service management:

- Customers can **browse and request services** (like plumbing, electrical work).
- Service workers see **assigned requests** in a dashboard.
- Workers use **QR code scanning** to **validate and mark jobs as complete**.
- All data updates **real-time** via Firebase.

Built to **simplify** and **digitize** the service booking process.

## üöÄ How It Works

Clients request services through the platform.
Service providers see their assigned requests.
When on-site, the provider scans the client's QR code to confirm the task.
Upon successful scan, the request is marked completed in the database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
